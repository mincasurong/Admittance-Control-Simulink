# Admittance Control Simulation in Simulink

This repository contains Simulink models and MATLAB scripts for simulating admittance control systems. Admittance control is a method used in robotic systems to ensure smooth and compliant interactions with the environment.

## Contents

- **Simulink Models:**
  - **[AdmittanceControl.slx](AdmittanceControl.slx)**: Main Simulink model for admittance control simulation.
  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB and Simulink (for running the models and scripts)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Admittance-Control-Simulink.git
    cd Admittance-Control-Simulink
    ```

## Admittance Control

Admittance control is a robotic control strategy where the robot adjusts its motion in response to external forces. It is particularly useful in applications where the robot interacts with dynamic and unpredictable environments.

### Key Features

- **Smooth Interaction**: Ensures smooth and compliant interactions between the robot and its environment.
- **Parameter Initialization**: Easy initialization of parameters through MATLAB scripts.
- **Result Visualization**: Plots the results of the simulation for analysis.
